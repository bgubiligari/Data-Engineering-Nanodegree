Project Overview:

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Postgres database with fact and dimension tables is created to analyze songs and user activity.Business can analyze the data in these tables to get valuable insights in to songs popularity and how much time users are spending time listening to these songs

Datasets

Song Dataset - This dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID

Log Dataset - This dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations

Database Schema Design

The dimension table users contains the users data
The dimension table songs contains the details about the songs 
The dimension table artists contains data about the artists
The dimension table time contains the timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific time units such as year,month,day and hour
The fact table songplays contains the records in log data associated with song plays

Scripts Execution

Execute the script create_tables.py to create the database and tables
Load the data in to dimension and fact tables using etl.py script
